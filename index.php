	  	<span class='capital'>O</span>ver the last few years I've split my time between
		harpsichord building and working at software startups, focusing more on one for awhile, then
		going back to the other.  They're both interesting, and it's fun to move back and forth from 
		the new economy to the (really) old economy. 
		</p><p>
		I spent three years as an apprentice in the studio of 
		<a href='http://www.kevinfryer.net'>Kevin Fryer</a>, then worked as a software developer 
		for two years at <a href='http://www.cohuman.com'>Cohuman</a>. Now I'm back in the workshop, building
		  a new harpsichord (current progress <a href='gallery/op5.php'>here</a>).
		</p><p>
		I've built four instruments so far, the first two from kits and the most recent two from scratch.
		I sold the first three, including the one pictured to the right, and the fourth is in 
		my living room, where I try to keep the kids from destroying it.
