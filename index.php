		experience, the most common question is: how did you wind up in such an odd field?  For me, the answer is: in 
		a very roundabout way.  I started out as a trombonist, then worked as a software engineer, and now I make 
		harpsichords.  I've been interested in early keyboard instruments ever since, as a young piano student,
		I discovered to my astonishment that J.S. Bach did not in fact write for the piano, but for the harpsichord.  I first 
		played one in college, and I built my first one from a kit in 2006.

		I spent three years as an apprentice in the studio of 
		<a href='http://www.kevinfryer.net'>Kevin Fryer</a>, then set up my own shop in Palo Alto.
		I've built three instruments on my own so far, two <a href='gallery'>Flemish singles</a> and one 
		<a href='gallery/op6.php'>French double</a>.
